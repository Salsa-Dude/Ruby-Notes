# Why do we need classes?
# - ruby built in objects like Arrays or Hashes cannot represent everything
# - The goal of object oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes 
# - An object is a custom container for data. It is made from a class.
# - Object group functionalities into a single unit

# Object Attributes and Methods
# - Instance variables (attributes) are variables that belong to the object
# - Attributes provide information about the object's current state
# - Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object
# - Encapsulation is OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object

# Classes and Objects
# - A class is the blueprint, pattern, template or outline for an object
# - An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class
# - Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class
